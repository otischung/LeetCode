# 1937. Maximum Number of Points with Cost

Difficulty: <font color=#FF8B00>Medium</font>

## Description

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `points` (**0-indexed**). Starting with `0` points, you want to **maximize** the number of points you can get from the matrix.

To gain points, you must pick one cell in **each row**. Picking the cell at coordinates `(r, c)` will **add** `points[r][c]` to your score.

However, you will lose points if you pick a cell too far from the cell that you picked in the previous row. For every two adjacent rows `r` and `r + 1` (where `0 <= r < m - 1`), picking cells at coordinates `(r, c1)` and `(r + 1, c2)` will **subtract** `abs(c1 - c2)` from your score.

Return *the **maximum** number of points you can achieve*.

`abs(x)` is defined as:

- `x` for `x >= 0`.
- `-x` for `x < 0`.



**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2,3],[1,5,1],[3,1,1]]
Output: 9
Explanation:
The blue cells denote the optimal cells to pick, which have coordinates (0, 2), (1, 1), and (2, 0).
You add 3 + 5 + 3 = 11 to your score.
However, you must subtract abs(2 - 1) + abs(1 - 0) = 2 from your score.
Your final score is 11 - 2 = 9.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[1,5],[2,3],[4,2]]
Output: 11
Explanation:
The blue cells denote the optimal cells to pick, which have coordinates (0, 1), (1, 1), and (2, 0).
You add 5 + 3 + 4 = 12 to your score.
However, you must subtract abs(1 - 1) + abs(1 - 0) = 1 from your score.
Your final score is 12 - 1 = 11.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == arrays.length`
- `2 <= m <= 105`
- `1 <= arrays[i].length <= 500`
- `-104 <= arrays[i][j] <= 104`
- `arrays[i]` is sorted in **ascending order**.
- There will be at most `105` integers in all the arrays.
